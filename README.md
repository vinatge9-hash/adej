# Niyantri Coffee Website

This is a static, five-page coffee shop website built with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It includes: 
- Home (index.html)
- Menu (menu.html)
- Cart (cart.html) with PayPal sandbox integration
- About (about.html)
- Contact (contact.html)

How to run:
- Open the HTML files directly in a browser or host on a static server.
- PayPal Integration: Uses the sandbox client-id (sb). Replace with a production client-id for live payments.

Notes:
- The main content uses full-width and responsive Tailwind classes (no fixed-width containers).
- Images use the placeholder format: src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6328831/pexels-photo-6328831.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" as requested.
- All styling is done via Tailwind CSS classes embedded in the HTML. No external CSS files.
